## 📋 Problem Summary
- **High Cost of Digital Art Creation**: Creating digital art usually requires expensive software, which many users cannot afford.
- **Time-Consuming Process**: Manual illustration takes a significant amount of time, which is not practical for users who want quick results.
- **Lack of Customization**: Offering basic text-to-image generation without the ability to guide pose or style.
- **High Hardware Requirements**: Running the model locally requires a high-VRAM GPU.
